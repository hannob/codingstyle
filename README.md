===========

Codingstyle notes for [Hanno Böck's](https://hboeck.de) code projects

Python
------

See [PYTHON.md](PYTHON.md).

C
-

Use *clang-format* with default settings (equivalent to *--style=LLVM*) and *-Werror*.

Markdown
--------

Use *markflow*.

Misc
----

Software licenses are commonly stored in files called `COPYING` or `LICENSE`. I used
them inconsistently in the past, but moving forward, I will use `COPYING` for all new
projects

About
-----

This repo contains notes about codingstyle and linting tools [Hanno Böck](
https://hboeck.de/) uses for his own code.
